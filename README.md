Course Project on Developing Data Product

## Quick Introduction to user interface

This course project has produced a Shiny application (code published here), deployed in [Rstudio's shiny server](http://jcllorente.shinyapps.io/DevDataProject/) and also some [supporting documentation](https://github.com/jcllorente/DevDataProj_deck).

It uses the famous Fisher's or Anderson's iris data set. Aim pursued other than learning is to **test the correlation and linear regression fit among 2 pairs of predictors, length and width of either sepal and petal**.

All input variables are initialized for main output to display since start of runof application, assuming nothing goes unexpectedly wrong.

Feel free to interact with:

1. Radio button to select variable pair to process: Sepal or Petal. 

2. Slider to select size of random sample of data to use: from 15 to 150 records. 
3. Checkboxes to request optional summary data, any of the following: 
    * correlation factor among variables selected, and 
    * intercept, beta coefficient, residual standard error (sigma) and multiple R-squared of the corresponding linear regression fit. 

4. Numeric input box and action button for final surprise.
